#### Instructions

1. Create components as much as possible especially for any repeatable code.
2. Hit this endpoint: 
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xomly/profile-screen-test/master/api/users/4932.json` 
for all fake user data information.
3. These exact image/icons are not necessary, but an image/icon should be provided. [React-Native-Vector-Icons](https://github.com/oblador/react-native-vector-icons) library is already included in application.
4. Navigation is not required.  If you don't know how to navigate, create an alert that tells where it navigates to instead of preforming the navigation on press.
5. "Learn More" and "All Activities" should be buttons.  When the button is pressed show a View with extra text beneath the button.  When the button is pressed again hide that View.
6. Bonus Points for adding navigation/animations/redux etc.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
